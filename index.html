  <h1> History of Donald Kunth </h1>
  <p1> Donald Ervin Knuth is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is a professor emeritus at
    Stanford University. He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of
    computer science. Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms.</p1>
</body>
<body>
  <h2> Education </h2>
  <p2>Knuth received a scholarship in physics to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western
    Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, enrolling in 1956.He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi
    fraternity. While studying physics at Case, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, an early commercial computer. After
    reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his
    school because he believed he could do it better. In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball
    team win its games.He assigned "values" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel
    approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.</p2>

  <h3> Early Work </h3>
  <p3> In 1963, after receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an assistant professor.Knuth accepted
    a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, he decided
    that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming,
    which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book, but as he
    developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover
    the subject. He published the first volume in 1968 </p3>

  <h4> Contributions </h4>
  <p4> Donald Kunth contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of
    algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic
    notation </4>

  <h5> Honers and Awards </h5>
  <p5> In total Donald Kunth has 44 honers and awards including the Grace Murray Hopper Award, ACM (1971)
    Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973)
    Turing Award, ACM (1974)
    Lester R Ford Award, Mathematical Association of America (1975)
    Member, National Academy of Sciences (1975) </p5>
