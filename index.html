  <h1>History of Donald Kunth </h1>
  <p1>Donald Ervin Knuth is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford
    University. He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer
    science. Knuth has been called the "father" of the analysis of algorithms. Knuth received a scholarship in physics
    to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve
    University) in Cleveland, Ohio, enrolling in 1956.He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity.
    While studying physics at Case, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, an early commercial computer. After reading the
    computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school
    because he believed he could do it better. In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win
    its games.He assigned "values" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel approach
    that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on. In 1963, after receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's
    faculty as an assistant professor.Knuth accepted a
    commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, he decided
    that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming,
    which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book, but as he
    developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover
    the subject. He published the first volume in 1968 In total Donald Kunth has 44 honors and awards including the
    Grace Murray Hopper Award, ACM (1971)
    Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973)
    Turing Award, ACM (1974)
    Lester R Ford Award, Mathematical Association of America (1975)
    Member, National Academy of Sciences (1975)
    A quote from Donald Kunth
    "Programing is the art of telling another human being what one wants a computer to do"</p1>
